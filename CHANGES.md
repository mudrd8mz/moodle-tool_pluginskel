  workflow functionality. Sorry for the noise.

## 1.5.2 ##

* Single class (instance, trait) files do not need file-level phpDocs block even if
  they have side-effect and load other libraries manually.
* Monolog logger update to the latest version 2.2 as we now require Moodle 3.9 so PHP
  is always 7.2 or higher.
* Plugin types in the wizard form selector are now alphabetically ordered - credit
  goes to Daniel Neis Araujo and Jonathan Champ.

  generated code.

## 1.5.1 ##

* New recipe section `templates` allowing to generate mustache templates.
* Fixed standard boilerplate of all custom skeleton templates and re-enabled CI
  prechecks for them.

## 1.5.0 ##

* New recipe section `external` can be used to describe external functions provided by
  the plugin.
* New recipe section `services` can be used to describe pre-built web services
  provided by the plugin.
* The `--recipe` argument has been deprecated. The path to the recipe file should be
  newly provided via positional argument of the generate.php script.
* CLI generator script now also supports relative paths to files as arguments.
* New `--list-files` argument allows to display list of to-be generated files.
* New `--file` argument allows to display the contents of given generated file.
* New `--decode` argument allows to display decoded structure of given YAML file.
* Added ability to generate single declaration files that have no side effects.
* Travis-CI prechecks were replaced with Github Actions.
* Github Actions are also used to precheck generated skeletons, not only the tool
  itself. Various detected coding style issues were fixed in both places.
* Generated README files now contain information about how and where the generated
  plugin should be installed to. Credit goes to Jan Dagef√∂rde.
* Generated install.xml files fixed to contain EOL at EOF. This reflects the upstream
  fix MDL-70931.
